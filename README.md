Training example for copilot showcases

actions to know before start:
* Accept an inline suggestion	Tab
* Dismiss an inline suggestion	Esc
* Show next inline suggestion	Alt+]
* Show previous inline suggestion	Alt+[
* Trigger inline suggestion	Alt+\
* Open GitHub Copilot (additional suggestions in separate pane)	Alt+Enter
* Open GitHub Copilot (additional suggestions in same pane)	Alt+Shift+Enter

There will be multiple parts to the training exercise:
* A simple Class creation for a fantasy Dwarf hardware store.
* A  more complex class creation for Materials and some products for the store.
* As automated as possible test case creation.
* Comment based context provision



Note that the code will not compile, since the code examples that copilot provided is left, even when it was generating thing incorrectly.


Simple summary:
* Copilot is good at generating simple classes, but not so good at generating more complex classes.
* Code generated will try to generate similar code to what it has seen before, even when it is not making any logical sense.
* Copilot shines on boilerplate code generation, but not so much on more complex code generation.
* Adjustment to your written code will happen over time, short term examples will be prioritized (most recent use cases are associated).
* Multifile use cases are not handled well, and will generate code that is not correct.
